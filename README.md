# About The Tahara App
The Tahara app was built in order to help women around the world manage their tahara in an easy way. The features that are implemented are:
* Automatic Prisha dates calculation at a click of a button - right now in the market there are mostly calculators out there, where you still need to put dates manually, we want to improve that by having a button a women can click on her period day and it'd calculate all the dates for her instead of doing this manually
* Reminders - We have prisha dates reminders,and hefsek tahara reminders, 7 clean days reminders and more coming soon.
* Manual dates selection - we still allow manual dates selection in case a women forgot to fill her date, or in case she wants to update it.
* Simple & easy to use - the app is simple and easy to use, the UI is built with Material design for a better UX.

# Coming Soon
* More options - different methods for calculations, veset kavoa options, and more halachic options.
* Reminders - We will have prisha dates reminders, hefsek tahara reminders, 7 clean days reminders and more.
* Biotz - We will have an automatic biotz day calculator 
* Got any suggestions? Feel free to contribute or contact me and we'll try to implement them.
