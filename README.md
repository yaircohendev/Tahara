# Tahara App
Currently the app is at BETA version and I plan on releasing it after doing more tests with beta users. (As this is a sensitive subject, and dates must be accurate)

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
